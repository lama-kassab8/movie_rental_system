# Movie Rental System

A simple Python-based movie rental system that allows users to manage movies, rent and return them, and add or remove users. Data is stored in JSON files, and the system includes functionality for handling movie availability, rental status, and user management.

## Description

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) application for a movie rental system. The application allows users to:
- Add movies to the system.
- View available and rented movies.
- Rent and return movies.
- Add and remove users.

The data for both movies and users is stored in JSON files (`movies.json` and `users.json`). Each movie has a title, genre, and availability status, while users have names, IDs, and a list of rented movies.
